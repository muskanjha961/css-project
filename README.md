# Amazon Homepage Clone (HTML + CSS)

Hi   
This is a small project I made while practicing **HTML and CSS**.  
I tried to recreate the look of Amazonâ€™s homepage with a simple layout, navigation bar, product grid, and some basic styling.  

##Whatâ€™s inside?
- `index.html` â†’ the main structure of the page  
- `style.css` â†’ all the styling for the layout, colors, and design  


##What I learned
- How to use **flexbox** for creating layouts  
- Linking an external CSS file with HTML  
- Positioning elements like header, search bar, and product sections  
- Giving the page a clean and organized look with CSS
